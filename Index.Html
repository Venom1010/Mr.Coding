     <div><h2>Is Coding hard? </h2></div>

<p> Here’s a list of reasons why something might be considered hard or difficult for kids:

    It’s new
    It’s different
    It takes time
    It takes persistence
    It lacks resources

Does coding fall into any one of those buckets? Sure, you could potentially put coding in all of them depending on the circumstances. 

But if you think about it, you can say the same for most anything.

For instance, for me personally, I’d say that learning how to play guitar is hard. Learning how to juggle is hard. See where I'm going with this?

Learning how to do anything new is typically going to be hard, and that’s what makes those who know how to do that something special. 

Which brings us to…
Is coding hard to learn?

No, coding is not hard to learn. However, like anything new, it's not easy to start, and how difficult a time one has with learning to code will vary across a number of factors.  

The point is, learning to code isn't impossible; or, it's not as impossible as it might seem when it comes to getting your kids involved. 

While learning might require them to tap into areas with which they don’t have prior familiarity, those who have the time, persistence, and dedication can start gaining coding experience just as they can learn to do something else. 

Meaning, plenty of people know how to code, leading many of those who are proficient in coding to launch the things we all enjoy using on a daily basis—from our apps, games, websites, robots, social media, and much more. 
Then why the resistance?

So if coding isn’t impossibly difficult, why does that perception exist?

Well for starters, coding is a hot, relevant topic. No offense to anyone who juggles, but it’s just not an activity you hear about on a daily basis. So, it could be the constant reminder that “coding is important” but yet “we need more coders” that makes coding seem like a difficult task.

     <div><h2> How to make a Scratch Project?</h2></div>

<p>To make a new project while a Scratch page other than the editor is open, click "Create" at the top of the website navigation bar. This will make a blank project with an "Untitled-(# here) title and the default Scratch Cat sprite. From there, the project can be designed in the Scratch 3.0 Online Editor. In the offline editor, access File > New project to create a new project.

One can also click "See project page" to edit the instructions and the Notes and Credits section once in the editor; and, can also click "Share" to allow others to view their project. Clicking will take you to the project's page, and there will be a green message above the project saying, "Your project is now shared."

A new project can also be created by going to this link, by going to "My Stuff" and clicking "New Project", or, while in the editor, you can click "File" > "New" and it will open a New Project for you, as well as saving the one you were working on.
