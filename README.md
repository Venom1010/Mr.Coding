Scratch is a high-level block-based visual programming language and website targeted primarily at children 8â€“16 as an educational tool for programming.[6][7] Users on the site, called Scratchers, can create projects on the website using a block-like interface. Projects can be exported to HTML5, Android apps and EXE files using external tools. The service is developed by the MIT Media Lab, has been translated into 70+ languages, and is used in most parts of the world.[8] Scratch is taught and used in after-school centers, schools, and colleges, as well as other public knowledge institutions. As of July 2021, community statistics on the language's official website show more than 82 million projects shared by over 74 million users, and more than 73 million monthly website visits.[8]  Scratch takes its name from a technique used by disk jockeys called "scratching", where vinyl records are clipped together and manipulated on a turntable to produce different sound effects and music. Like scratching, the website lets users mix together different media (including graphics, sound, and other programs) in creative ways by creating and remixing projects, like video games, animations, and simulations.
